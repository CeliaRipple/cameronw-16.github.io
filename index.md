A review of the article “Open Network for Local Self Sustainability, Boosting Bioregional Development Through an Open Data Sharing System” taken from the FOSS4G 2019 conference.

	This article explains a developing geodatabase called Open NETwork for Local Self Sustainability. The purpose of the database is to suggest a way to create the most self-sustainable communities, especially focusing on ways to make future community development take into account sustainability in their development planning. The database is modeled on Italian communities and focuses primarily on the scale of municipalities. The geodatabase aims to create self-sustainable communities by finding the most sustainable supply chain routes to a community for products that fall in the categories of housing, food, transport and waste. The indicators used to measure the self-sustainability of a supply chain for a product are the amounts of non-renewable primary energy, renewable primary energy, amount of productive land, and local manpower the chain uses. The database uses the opensource programs GRASS and QGIS to create the suggested sustainable supply chains. In the future, the database hopes to expand the types of supply chains that are included by drawing in different fields of research. 	To me, the open source nature of this project is extremely important to achieving this database’s goal. Being created on the open source programs QGIS and GRASS allow almost anyone to have access to the program, which is key in not only disseminating the program to city planners but also allowing people from different areas of research to contribute their supply chain data to the geodatabase. The Open NETwork for Local Self Sustainability necessitates different groups working together to achieve sustainability goals.
